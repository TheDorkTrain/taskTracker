# Task Tracker

## Description

This Task Board is a great tool for keeping track of a number of tasks and monitoring them each day to see what needs to be prioritized.

## Usage

Website: https://thedorktrain.github.io/taskTracker/

When ready to log a new task you can click the "Add Task" Button and enter information. Then you can drag the task to one of the three catergories depending on the status of the task. Whenever you come back to check on your tasks the next day, they will update and if they are due that day you will see a color warning appear.
